## Optimizing Sales Strategies: A Data-Driven Analysis of Product Discounts and Market Trends for Eniac's Apple-Compatible Accessories Marketplace

This is the second project in WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Science Bootcamp.

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is the subject of the project, which aims to investigate whether Eniac should consider offering product discounts to enhance its sales.
The business needs clarity in the following aspects: 

- How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
-	How many products are being discounted?
-	How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
-	How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
-	How could data collection be improved?
  
Before addressing the business questions, the dataset's data quality is evaluated, and necessary data cleaning is conducted.

Here is an overview of the project:
